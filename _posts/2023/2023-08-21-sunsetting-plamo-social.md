This choice does not come easy, but in the coming months I will be taking the steps to sunset the plamo.social Mastodon instance. I've tried to ignore issues for a while, but I would like to take a chance to breakdown how we got here in the first place. For those of you reading this that are a frequent user, I am sorry - I had never exactly planned for this outcome.

## How we got here

In April of 2022, the plamo.social server was spun up as an attempt to provide those in the hobbyist modeling community a replacement for Twitter (now X? idk). My initial mistake was a "if you build it, they will come" approach. Many people have signed up over the lifetime of the server - however traction has always been less than ideal. One core need for a social network to thrive is the network itself - and that I cannot provide on my own.

Most if not all advertisement was word of mouth and discovery of the server came from that or those finding it through searches on Google, Twitter, etc. One of my initial fears was the server becoming unruly due to not having a well established content policy - so registrations have all required approvals, especially after a rash of bot signups.

User activity has never exactly been as active as I hoped - or in the way I had hoped, I understand that many like to just lurk - I have tried to remedy the current discovery experience through frequent posts and suggestions to educate those on how to find what they may be after and to get a more engaging timeline.There was also a project planned out to provide a bot to suggest posts based on your social graph, though that is far from ready for production.

While I wasn't seeing posts from every active user, I was definitely seeing activity at the systems level in terms of resources needed. I am professionally a software engineer, so I was no stranger to managing and manintaing the systems infrastructure and even found it a welcome challenge to help me diversify my own skill set. The infrastructure itself hasn't come without its own challenges, including tuning it to make sure it is available during what has appeared to be peak hours of usage and resetting resources during off hours to free up memory.

User engagement and system stability aside, the core issue has been this entire project has been self funded. While plamo.social is operated by Plamo Social LLC, it's still just one person behind the scenes. Funding has been an issue as the needs of the server has grown & I never expected nor planned to make revenue off this venture, however I also misjudged how much would be gained from donations. As the server grew, the next steps in the needed infrastructure requirements to keep things available & operational were going to grow monthly costs significantly which help push me in this direction. Truth be told, I had long passed the point of comfort in terms of funding this on my own and I just haven't been wanting to see this day come.

## Where we go from here

Over the following months, a timeline will unfold. I will immediately disable the Patreon, thank you for those who generously donated. I will be disabling any relays used by plamo.social and I advise those of you to not longer post and instead seek a new home to migrate to if you so desire.

Following the guidelines of the [https://joinmastodon.org/covenant](Mastodon Server Covenant), plamo.social will remain available for 3 months (ending on December 1, 2023) - at this time you will have a chance to download any archives and migrate yourself to a new home in the fediverse, allowing all of your existing connections to properly get rerouted.

For information about migrating yourself, see https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/

If you are seeking a new home within the hobby related niche, I would recommend some of the following to check out as part of your move:
- warhammer.social
- dice.camp
- miniature.photography (pixelfed)
- sakurajima.moe

After the shutdown has occurred, the domain will display this post or some brief version of it. Maybe in the future plamo.social come back as something better served for the needs of the community.

If you wish to keep in contact, there is a Discord server that was spun up for patrons https://discord.gg/njqttwBM

Thank you all for the past couple years - I wish you all the best of luck, see you online and happy building.
