# DMCA Requests

## Reporting claims of copyright infringement

If you would like to submit a claim of copyright infrigmenet (often referred to as a ‘takedown notice’), please send an e-mail request in compliance with the [US Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/dmca-directory/) standard requirements to [dmca@plamo.social](mailto:dmca@plamo.social). Per the US Copyright Office website, a successful claim requires:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allededly infringed.
7. We will respond to these requests as quickly as we are able.

## Counter Notification Proceedures

If you believe that material you posted on the Website was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter notification with us (a “Counter Notice”) by submitting the following to [dmca@plamo.social](mailto:dmca@plamo.social):

1. Your electronic signature.
2. An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled.
3. Adequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address).
4. A statement under penalty of perjury by you that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
5. A statement that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or if you reside outside the United States for any judicial district in which the owner of the Website resides).
6. The DMCA allows us to restore the removed content if the party filing the original DMCA Notice does not file a court action against you within ten business days of receiving the copy of your Counter Notice. Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on the Website was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorney’s fees) under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act of 1976.

## Repeat Infringers

Our policy is to suspend or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers of copyright. The exact number of repeated infringements required is the sole discretion of the [moderation team](/team).
