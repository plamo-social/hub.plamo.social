# Welcome to plamo.social!

## Focus

**This is less of an "on-topic" explainer and more of an info blob about what kind of content can be anticipated on the local timeline by joining plamo.social.**

Like the server's name would indicate, the primary user group of this server are those who are enthusiasts of "[plamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plamo)", or plastic modeling.

This encapsulates any and all hobby modeling done in plastic or resins, including fantasy, sci-fi, & military modeling; construction of pre-molded kits, kit bashing, scratch building, miniature painting, and the collection of pre-assembled, fully finished models (toys, figures, sofubi, etc).

Also included (but not limited to) are any of the adjacent topics such as gaming, anime, film, literature, history, art, 3D design & printing, etc.

## Server Language

This is primarily an **English** speaking instance, but all are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](https://hub.plamo.social/coc) at plamo.social can be simply summarised as:

1. Don't harass anyone.
2. If someone is harassing you, report it to a moderator.
3. Have fun.
4. Be excellent to each other.

We block some other instances. The full list is available to our users upon request and we welcome feedback and suggestions. There are plenty of "Free Speech Zones" on the internet, but this is not one of them, and this instance will not openly federate with instances self-describing in that way.

Otherwise, we recommend checking out [instances.social](https://instances.social/) or [joinmastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) to find a better fit.
