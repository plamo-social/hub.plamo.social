This document lays out the ground rules for participating in the plamo.social community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document, so the [plamo.social team](/team) may amend this document to better meet these goals in the future.

This is _not_ a legal document and our team will address gray areas as they arise. This document is to provide insight into the values that drive moderation decisions.

## The Gist

The code of conduct at plamo.social can be summarised as:

* Don't harass anyone.
* If someone is harassing you, report it to a moderator.
* Have fun.
* Be excellent to each other.

## Goals

* Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.
* Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.
* Provide a venue for both casual and serious conversation, with the ability for users to opt-out of unwanted content.

## Non-Goals

While it’s important to know what plamo.social is, it’s just as important to understand what we’re not.

plamo.social is **not**:

* *A "free speech zone"* - plamo.social is a community with specific — and high — standards of behaviour. If you would like to exercise your full free speech rights, you can do so somewhere else; while on plamo.social, you should agree to follow the community rules set out in this document.
* *An experts-only space* - We all share a collective love of our hobby, but no user should be shamed for not understanding a basic concept or for asking questions. Asking questions is encouraged to help each other grow.
* *A place for general advertisement* - Promoting your original work is welcome and so is sharing cool stuff you found, but advertising others work or reselling items is not the primary goal for the instance, and you may find another server to be a better fit.

If you’re looking for any of the above, check out [instances.social](https://instances.social/) or [joinmastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) to find a better fit.

## What action can I take?

In many ways, you are your own moderator. Instance moderators will help you by enforcing server policies to limit bad behavior (as defined in the section below). However, you have many additional options available to curate your own timeline:

* Mute accounts you don’t want to see content from, but you’re ok with them seeing yours.
* Block accounts you don’t want to see you.
* Block instances that produce content you would rather not see.
* Report content & instances that violates the server code of conduct.

## Public Posts

Public Posts are those that are posted to the public timelines. This means that anyone on plamo.social can see your post on the local timeline and anyone on the Internet can see your Post via the [see what's happening](https://plamo.social/public) page. This also means that your Post will be visible to any instances that plamo.social federates with, via the federated timeline.

## Non-Public Posts

At plamo.social, we consider a non-public Post to be Posts that are not posted to the public timelines. These include Posts that are posted with the following privacy settings:

* **Unlisted** - Not posted to public timelines, but viewable if someone visits your profile.
* **Follower-only** - Only viewable by a user who follows you.
* **Direct** - Only viewable to users who are @ mentioned in a Post.

Users who follow you have consciously opted in to what you have to say. By using *Follower-only* you are talking direct to those people, and not the wider Fediverse. People who follow you are more likely to understand the context and tone of what you're trying to say.

**Always use a CW where appropriate, even for *Follower-only* and *Direct* Posts.**

## Rules for All Posts

All posts (public and private) should abide by the following rules:

* **Do not use slurs or racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or hateful jokes or language** or promote white supremacy, anti-Semitism, transphobia or other hateful ideologies.
* **Do not harass anyone**, participate in group harassment of anyone, or otherwise engage in personal attacks. Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing") constitutes harassment.
* **Do not be intentionally antagonistic.** A post or reply designed to provoke a confrontation is not acceptable.
* **Do not post adult content without a Content Warning**, including pictures containing nudity, or unwelcome sexual attention (including sexualized comments or jokes).
* **Do not post spam**. Posts that are nothing other than a link and/or contain an inordinate number of hashtags constitute spam, as does any overly commercial self-promotion. (It is fine, however, to post about your own projects and share what you are excited to be working on — just keep the post itself interesting).
* **Do not use automated tools to post without participating in the community**. It is fine to post with an automated tool (e.g., a Twitter cross-poster) so long as you are an active member of the plamo.social community and respond to replies you receive here. However, unmonitored accounts that post automatically are not acceptable.
* **Do not ["shitpost"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting)** - while humorous posts are allowed, and actually encouraged, there is no place for "shitposting" on plamo.social.
* **Do not post illegal or illicit content.** This includes unlicensed media. We will remove DMCA reports we receive.
* **Do use hashtags liberally**, and keep them relevant to the content of your post. Use CamelCase for mutli-word hashtags to make them accessible to text readers for the visually impared. For example, #ThisIsHowToDoIt, instead of #thisishowtodoit.
* **Have fun!!**

## Additional Rules for Public Posts

Public posts should follow the above rules and should also abide by the following additional rules:

* **Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.** Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all on the public timeline. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory posts without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.
* Do not engage in name calling, [ad hominem](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem) attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour; criticize ideas, never people.
* **Do not tone police.** Other posts may violate the standards of civility we set on plamo.social, but you should not criticize users for their tone. If the user is a member of the plamo.social community, you should report them; if not, you should feel free to block them. In neither case should you criticize their tone.
* **Try to post English** While this is primarily an English speaking instance and other languages are welcome, posting in other languages can make it difficult for moderation.
* **Do not debate moderation actions in public posts.** If you disagree with how a moderator enforced this CoC you may direct-message the moderation team or email [hello@plamo.social](mailto:hello@plamo.social).

Always remember that your public posts are read not only by our *existing* community members (who may have the context to know what you mean) but by potential future community members as well. Strive to keep the local timeline representative of the inclusive, friendly community we want to build.

## Moderation
If you notice a post that violates this code of conduct, promptly click on the three dots at the bottom of the post and report it. We will make a best effort to resolve reports within 48 hours.

It is easy to assume that someone else has already reported a post, but it is easy for everyone to feel that way [and no one to report the post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect). When choosing “spam” or “other” report reasons, please include a short description of why you are reporting the post.

> If you believe something is not a good contribution to the community, but is not covered by our Code of Conduct, please report it with a comment about why you are reporting it. The moderation team will take appropriate action

As a rule of thumb, content which violates our server rules will be deleted. If the moderation team finds that a user repeatedly violates server rules, they may be suspended. Similarly, if an instance receives a lot of reports they may be defederated.

If you notice a post that violates this code of conduct, *please* report it. 

## After a Report
When our moderators receive a report, we will investigate to understand the context of the account being reported and the interactions that led up to the report. If our team decides that the content goes against our code of conduct, we will take corrective action.

If you disagree with, or do not understand, a moderation decision you can file an appeal using the tool linked to in the email you receive. Appeals abide by a few rules:

* Be respectful. If your appeal is disrespectful, it’s unlikely to be approved.
* You will not be assessed by the same moderator twice. Appeals will be assessed by a different moderator than the one that took corrective action
* We will get to them as soon as we can. While appeals are important, they will fall behind other work such as server stability or outstanding reports. We are not ignoring them, but they may take a few days.

### Let the moderators moderate

If you see a post that potentially contravenes this Code of Conduct, **do not** try to moderate, reprimand or enforce this CoC. That is the job of the moderation team.

Instead, please report the post to the moderation team, who will take appropriate action.

## Catch-all

The moderation team will always take a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn't explicitly called out in this CoC, yet is inappropriate for plamo.social, the post will likely be removed and the member will be dealt with appropriately.
